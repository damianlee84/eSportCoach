I wasn't really too sure what to expect, but he explained everything to me and was very patient and understanding. From all my interactions with the guy, it seems like his intentions are good. I would recommend him to others and trust him again.")

He was nice at first, but as we played together, I saw that his attitude and playstyle became very aggressive. At the end of our first session he linked me videos that were for beginners, which did not help at all.' Upon asking me why I didn't want to do another session with him, he became angry with me and accused me of using DotaCoach.org for hook-ups just because I wanted a coach from the Americas! He then told me I needed to change my lifestyle, and that's the last I'm ever planning to talk to him. I was trying to be nice, being one of his very students, but I cannot overlook the fact that he is just too bad-manned and aggressive for me, and probably the same for most kind people who are trying to navigate this site.")

Not only did he have a clear understanding of the session's topic but effective in communicating instructions. He is polite and ready to teach per any level or skill of play. Overall 5/5 would recommend.")

First watched him play a pub match using storm and went through decision making and how to play storm at a higher level. We then went into a lobby where he went through patiently on techniques and tricks of using the hero. Really helpful and would definitely get more sessions in the future. ")

He really goes in depth for what needs to be done!

I learned a lot about efficient spell and item usage and some of the things that I could do to get more out of both laning and my spells. HuntaeLa did a good job of balancing what we needed to work on as a team, while also helping me individually and answering my questions. Very knowledgeable about the game, and made clear and easy to understand points. He also did a really good job of making sure I understood the concepts he was trying to explain. Overall a great experience, 5 stars.")
