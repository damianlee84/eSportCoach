API
###

**steamOpenID** <https://steamcommunity.com/dev>
  - Valve provides these APIs so website developers can use data from Steam
    in new and interesting ways. They allow developers to query Steam for
    information that they can present on their own sites. At the moment the
    only APIs we offer provide item data for Team Fortress 2, but this list
    will grow over time.
